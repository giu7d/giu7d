I work as a web developer since 2017. I course Computer Science and Information Systems. My most valuable skill is in front-end development, but I get out of my comfort zone on more than one occasion to help my team with other demands.

  - JavaScript
  - TypeScript
  - UI/UX

  - MongoDB
  - Postgres
  - And many others... check out my repos to see some of my experiments! 👀
